    <h1 class="titleText">Preparation for ANZCA Final Examination</h1>
    <p>
      I am not an examiner. Neither am I an examination technique specialist.
      But, I <strong>am</strong> someone who has had to sit the Final Exam twice.
      Below you will find some learning points that I discovered along the way
      that I hope you might find helpful.
    </p>

    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#third-year">Don't sit in your third year</a></li>
      <li><a href="#study-group">Have a study group</a></li>

    <h3 id="third-year">Don't sit in your third year</h3>
    <p>
      I decided to sit my Exam in my third year.
      My thinking was along the lines of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Preparing for the Exam will force me to study rather than stagnate</li>
      <li>I hear the Final Exam is much easier than the primary - I want to get it over with so I can live my life</li>
      <li>If I sit during my fourth year and fail, then it might delay progressing with my training</li>
      <li>I know people who sat in their third year and passed - why couldn't I do the same?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This turned out to be a mistake. What I had failed to recognise were of quite a significance. These are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The third year is where transition to independent practice and Obstetrics and Paediatrics specialty terms occur - this often is the only window of opportunity perhaps in your entire career (especially for Paediatrics) for obtaining a concentrated exposure to these specialties</li>
      <li>The Exam assesses "consultant-level thinking" - this can only come with the <strong>experience</strong> that only really occurs after the third year</li>
      <li>Most people sit during the first sitting - more resources for Exam preparation are available for this sitting than the second</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For these reasons I now strongly recommend to everyone to not sit the Exam in the third year.
    </p>
<hr>
    <h3 id="study-group">Have a study group</h3>
    <p>
      I did not have a formal study group for my Primary Exam. I was fortunate in that my training scheme was particularly invested in supporting trainees through the Primary Exam.
      There were formal teaching sessions, mock exams, WhatsApp groups to bounce ideas and ask questions if needed.
      But I did not believe in a formal study group for the Primary Exam - after all, it is about sitting down and clocking in the hours required to learn and memorise.
      I thought, "as long as I can exercise discipline, I should be fine." - fortunately for me, I did manage to pass this Exam.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I believe that the study group is <strong>critical</strong> for the Final Exam for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discipline is much more difficult to enact alone</li>
      <li>The group support lasts beyond the Exam</li>
      <li>We need a source of second-hand experience</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Firstly, as Advanced Trainees, we are considered to be capable of some independent practice and are entrusted with much more after-hours duty.
      Studying to a schedule becomes much more difficult.
      Having a study group and "exteriorising" your commitment and discipline <strong>forces</strong> you to get through the work and stay on track.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, they are a great source of support both for the Exam and for the later consultant practice.
      After failing my anaesthetic viva, I did what most tend to do - <em>do more</em>.
      Later, I found that it is much more important to have some points of reference to indicate <strong>how</strong> you are progressing in terms of presentation style.
      My study group (Dr Annabel Lim and Dr Jonathan Lin) kindly offered their weekends and time off work to help me with viva practice and give me honest, constructive criticism that I really needed.
      I could really rely on their feedback to determine my progress as they have heard me week after week.
      Not only that, in our daily practice, we still ask each other clinical questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the Final Exam relies on the experience as it is a test of real-world practice and logic.
      Theoretical knowledge, as I found out the hard way, plays only a minor part in this.
      Far more important is the <strong>application</strong> of this knowledge and practice that is considered <strong>standard</strong> and <strong>safe</strong>.
      Unfortunately, we have only limited time, and we must rely on secondhand experience.
      In my personal case, I had only minimal paediatric and obstetric experience through generalist hospitals.
      As such my study group was critical for obtaining the second-hand paediatrics and obstetrics experience.
    </p>

    <h3 id="early-vivas">Prepare for the viva early</h3>
    <p>
      By this stage of our training, we have demonstrated the ability to rote learn and regurgitation facts - through medical school as well as the much dreaded Primary Exam.
      Of course, this does not make it easy - just familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Final Exam, especially the Anaesthesia Viva, requires a demonstration of safe and logical practice.
      In fact, I found that factual information was rarely assessed. The examiners were far more interested in <strong>what</strong> you would do, <strong>how</strong> you would do it and <strong>why.</strong>
      I have found this to be unnatural and unfamiliar, and it was very challenging to practise for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are my take-home points in preparing for the Anaesthesia Viva:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start early - mix it into the study for the written component</li>
      <li>Consider quality over quantity</li>
      <li>Develop a very simple system that can be applied in all situations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I needed a lot of time to shift my mindset from that of a trainee to that of a consultant. After all, it is often said that the Anaesthesia Viva should feel like a <em>consultant to consultant discussion.</em>
      Having never been a consultant, it was very difficult for me to appreciate how to achieve this.
      As such, I needed more time - perhaps more so than my peers - to make this happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are often told to <em>aim for 100 practise vivas</em>. Indeed an ANZCA Examiner had told me to aim for 150.
      <br /><strong>I question this advice</strong> and here are my reasons:<br />
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The fact that we managed to progress to the Anaesthesia Viva probably means that we <em>know</em> enough to pass - meaning that we probably don't need the quantity to cover the syllabus again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consultant-like thinking is an unfamiliar act to most trainees, and it should therefore be treated more like acquiring a skill.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      I believe what was more helpful for me was having 4-5 people from whom to get several vivas over time and obtaining their focused feedback regarding specific areas.
      In my case, it was demonstrating clear logical thinking and sounding more structured in my presentation.
