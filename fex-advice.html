    <h1 class="titleText">Preparation for ANZCA Final Examination</h1>
    <p>
      I am not an examiner. Neither am I an examination technique specialist.
      But, I <strong>am</strong> someone who has had to sit the final examination twice.
      Below you will find some learning points that I discovered along the way
      that I hope you might find helpful.
    </p>

    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't sit in your third year</li>
      <li>Have a study group</li>
      <li>Prepare for the viva early</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>Don't sit in your third year</h3>
    <p>
      I decided to sit my exam in my third year. In Victoria, this is where Obstetrics and Paediatrics terms tend to occur.
      My thinking was along the lines of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Preparing for the exam will force me to study rather than stagnate</li>
      <li>I hear the final exam is much easier than the primary. I want to get it over with so I can live my life</li>
      <li>If I sit during my fourth year and fail, then it might delay progressing with my training</li>
      <li>I know people who sit in their third year and pass. Why couldn't I do the same?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, what I had failed to recognise were of quite a significance. These are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Third year is where transition to independent practice and specialty obstetric/paediatric terms occur - This opportunity (especially paediatrics) might not come again</li>
      <li>The exam tests "consultant-level thinking" - Something that can only come with the <strong>experience</strong> that only really occurs after the third year</li>
      <li>Most people sit during the first sitting - More resources are available for this sitting than the second</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Have a study group</h3>
    <p>
      I did not have a formal study group for my Primary Exam. I was fortunate in that my training scheme was particularly invested in supporting trainees through the Primary Exam.
      There were formal teaching sessions, mock exams, Whatsapp groups to bounce ideas and ask questions if needed.
      But I really did not believe in a formal study group for this exam.
      After all, it is about sitting down and clocking in the hours required to learn and memorise.
      I thought, "as long as I can exercise discipline, I should be fine."
      Fortunately for me, I did manage to pass this exam.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Firstly, as Advanced Trainees are capable of some independent practice, we are entrusted with much more after-hours duty.
      Studying to a schedule becomes much more difficult.
      Having a study group and "exteriorising" your commitment and discipline <strong>forces</strong> you to get through the work and stay on track.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Secondly, they are a great source of support both for the exam and for the later consultant practice.
      After failing my anaesthetic viva, I did what most tend to do - do more.
      Later, I found that it is much more important to have some points of reference to indicate <strong>how</strong> you are progressing in terms of presentation style.
      My study group (Dr Annabel Lim and Dr Jonathan Lin) kindly offered their weekends and time off work to help me with viva practice and give me honest, constructive criticism that I really needed.
      I could really rely on their feedback to determine my progress as they have heard me week after week.
      Not only that, in our daily practice, we still ask each other clinical questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Final Exam is a test of real-world practice and the logic behind the solution to a problem.
      This obviously requires a sound theoretical knowledge. But (as I found out the hard way) this is only a small fraction of the whole. 
      The other portion requires the application of knowledge and a practice that is considered <strong>standard</strong> and <strong>safe</strong>.
      Unfortunately, we have only limited time, and we must rely on secondhand experience.
      In my personal case, due to a six-month interruption to my training, I ended up with extra BT-type rotations instead of moving on to Obstetrics and Paediatrics.
      During this time, my study group was critical for obtaining second-hand paediatric experience.
    </p>
    
    
    <h3>Prepare for the viva early</h3>
    <p>
      By this stage of our training, we have demonstrated the ability to pass exams - through medical school as well as the much dreaded Primary Exam.
      I did not find the book-work to be a critical issue. Of course, this does not mean that it is easy. Just not rate-limiting.
      I did manage to obtain enough points in the written section to be able to carry through my mark to the next sitting for the anaesthetic viva.
